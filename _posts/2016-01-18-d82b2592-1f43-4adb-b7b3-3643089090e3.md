Grading Technique

## 

Bear started on a Quadra FDL 90 and a Spirit 4k telecine but now operates the world's three most powerful colour grading and finishing systems for film, TV, commercials and broadcast - Filmlight's Baselight, DV's Filmmaster and Davinci's Resolve. Baselight, his prefered system, allows him to marry speed with creativity to enhance the artistry and narration and see the beauty and importance of each composition. His passionate and collaborative attitude has resulted in  great working relationships with clients such as Mike Leigh, Terry Gilliam, Ken Loach and Sir Paul McCartney.
